Run code in background indefinitely

This module allows you to keep running a script in the background indefinitely.
A great usage of this is fetching data in background and sending notifications with :py:mod:`notifications`. You can also run a server or a Discord bot for example.

Note: Because of privacy, apps cannot access to the clipboard in background, so coding a clipboard manager is not possible.
